# css-colors
This css file uses css variables to give you access to pleasing colors.
As opposed to regular css colors, where if you type 'red' you will see a disgusting color, with this file you will get a nice looking red.

You can access these colors by typing, for example: `background-color: var(--red)`

It contains a color for every normal name color, as well as light and dark version, for example, type `--light-red`.
